# ActiveRecord Clone

This is a minimal clone to duplicate some of the functionality of ActiveRecord. So far there is some basic query functionality with lazy evaluation in the Relation class, and belongs_to, has_many, and has_one_through associations. I plan to update this project when I have time.
